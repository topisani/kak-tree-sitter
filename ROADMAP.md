# Roadmap

This document gathers the next features and bug fixes to be introduced in the
next major and minor versions.

> How do I get my issue as part of the roadmap?

You should open a bug report or feature requests on one of the following lists:

- [Bug reports]
- [Feature requests]

You can also send an email the [discuss] mailing list.

> Patch versions are not meant to be part of any roadmap as they can land in
> any version, causing no breaking changes.
